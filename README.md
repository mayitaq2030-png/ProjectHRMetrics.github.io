# Employee Lifecycle & HR Metrics Analytics System for Saas Fintech

### Executive Summary:

<p align ="justify"> Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, I analyzed workforce performance to evaluate headcount trends, retention, turnover, and demographic distribution across the organization. The dashboard reveals strong workforce size (20,319 employees) but emerging gaps in retention, hiring pipeline consistency, and departmental distribution health. Insights highlight regions and job categories where staffing imbalances affect operational efficiency and workforce planning. These metrics uncover opportunities to optimize hiring strategies, improve retention programs, and strengthen HR resource allocation. </p>

🎯 Key areas of improvement:

- Optimize retention strategies in groups with declining engagement.

- Strengthen hiring pipelines to balance departmental talent distribution.

- Improve reporting automation for demographic and headcount insights.

### Business Problem:

<p align="justify"> Human Resources leadership requires a clear understanding of workforce capacity, demographic composition, and hiring–termination trends to plan staffing effectively. According to the dashboard, total headcount is 20,319, retention decreased by 0.5% YoY, and turnover while low at 0.8% still impacts critical roles in Engineering, Sales, Training, and Support. </p>
<p align="justify">
Additionally, 1012 hires and 163 terminations represent a hiring slowdown (-6.6%) and a reduction in departures (-6.3%), revealing mismatches between staffing needs and talent acquisition velocity. Departmental distribution shows heavy concentration in Human Resources (6110), Training (3048), and Engineering (1681), while Support and R&D remain comparatively understaffed. Demographic patterns such as age distribution, race, and gender—require continuous monitoring to ensure diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) objectives. </p>

HR leaders need a unified analytics model to support workforce planning, reduce workforce risk exposure, and improve hiring decisions.

### Methodology: 

- Data Extraction: SQL queries to retrieve headcount, demographic, hiring, termination, and departmental data.
- Data Transformation: Python (Pandas, Numpy) used for cleaning, merging, KPI calculations, and demographic categorization.
- Visualization: Power BI dashboard analyzing retention trends, turnover, hiring pipelines, geographic workforce distribution, and DEI metrics.
- Comparative Analysis: YoY headcount change, hiring vs. terminations variance, departmental imbalance detection, and demographic patterns.

### Skills:

- SQL: Joins, aggregations, demographic grouping, KPI computation.

- Python: Pandas, data cleaning, analytic transformations.

- Power BI: DAX, relationships, advanced KPI cards, map visuals, demographic charts.

- HR Analytics: Retention modeling, turnover analysis, workforce planning.

- BI Storytelling: Executive-level summarization and dashboard design.

### Results & Business Recommendations:

<p align="justify"> 
The dashboard reveals a workforce of 20,319 employees, with retention trending downward by 0.5% YoY, requiring HR intervention. Hiring volume decreased by 6.6%, indicating a slowdown in talent acquisition pipelines. Turnover remains low (0.8%) but affects key areas such as Engineering and Sales. Demographic insights show balanced gender distribution but uneven representation across age groups and race categories. Departmental staffing is skewed toward HR and Training while Support and R&D remain limited. These patterns highlight the need for strategic workforce planning and targeted hiring efforts. </p>

Because talent stability and balanced staffing are essential to operational performance, I recommend the following strategic adjustments:

- Strengthen retention programs in groups with declining engagement and tenure.

- Reinforce hiring pipelines to address departmental imbalances, especially in Support, R&D, and Engineering.

- Automate diversity reporting to monitor DEI metrics across gender, race, and age.

- Implement workforce forecasting to anticipate staffing shortages or skill gaps.

- Optimize geographic distribution by balancing remote vs. HQ talent as shown on the map

### Next Steps:

📌 Build predictive models for turnover risk and workforce demand forecasting.

📌 Automate monthly refresh for headcount and demographic dashboards.

📌 Integrate HRIS/ATS data to streamline hiring pipeline analytics.

📌 Present KPIs to HR leadership for budget and staffing plan alignment.
